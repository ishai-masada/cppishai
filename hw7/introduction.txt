(Description)
This program is supposed to use the idea that sunlight can affect your mood, specifically your "happiness". Given the
amount of sunlight you are in, the program outputs what the expected serotonin levels are. The program should be used
to determine how high your serotonin levels are.

(Tetsing)
The code was tested by comparing the input to the output. The input was an integer, and a function determined the output
based upon which range the input was in.
